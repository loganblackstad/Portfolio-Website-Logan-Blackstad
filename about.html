                      I fell in love with programming while working as a manufacturing engineer, where I was introduced to batch scripting, routing, networking, automation, computer vision, and more. I became captivated by computers and from that moment on I was motivated to learn more about the foundations of web applications. I wanted to interface with computers as directly as possible, and decided to build my career around the pursuit of this knowledge. Passionate about coding, learning, teamwork, and problem-solving. My greatest strength is seeing the big picture and understanding how all aspects of an operation coalesce.
